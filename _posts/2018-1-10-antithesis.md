**Antithesis** establishes a clear, contrasting relationship between two ideas by joining them together or juxtaposing them, often in parallel structure. Human beings are inveterate systematizers and categorizers, so the mind has a natural love for antithesis, which creates a definite and systematic relationship between ideas:

 - To err is human; to forgive, divine. --Pope
 - That short and easy trip made a lasting and profound change in Harold's outlook.
 - That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind. --Neil Armstrong
Antithesis can convey some sense of complexity in a person or idea by admitting opposite or nearly opposite truths:
 - Though surprising, it is true; though frightening at first, it is really harmless.
 - If we try, we might succeed; if we do not try, we cannot succeed.
 - Success makes men proud; failure makes them wise.
Antithesis, because of its close juxtaposition and intentional

contrast of two terms or ideas, is also very useful for making relatively fine distinctions or for clarifying differences which might be otherwise overlooked by a careless thinker or casual reader:

 - In order that all men may be taught to speak truth, it is necessary that all likewise should learn to hear it. --Samuel Johnson
 - The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice. --Matt. 23:2-3 (RSV)
 - I agree that it is legal; but my question was, Is it moral?
 - The advertisement indeed says that these shoes are the best, but it means that they are equal; for in advertising "best" is a parity claim and only "better" indicates superiority.
 
Note also that short phrases can be made antithetical:

 - Every man who proposes to grow eminent by learning should carry in his mind, at once, the difficulty of excellence and the force of industry; and remember that fame is not conferred but as the recompense of labor, and that labor, vigorously continued, has not often failed of its reward. --Samuel Johnson
