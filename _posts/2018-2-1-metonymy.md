**Metonymy**is another form of metaphor, very similar to synecdoche (and, in fact, some rhetoricians do not distinguish between the two), in which the thing chosen for the metaphorical image is closely associated with (but not an actual part of) the subject with which it is to be compared.
 - The orders came directly from the White House.
In this example we know that the writer means the President issued the orders, because "White House" is quite closely associated with "President," even though it is not physically a part of him. Consider these substitutions, and notice that some are more obvious than others, but that in context all are clear:
 - You can't fight city hall.
 - This land belongs to the crown.
 - In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread... --Genesis 3:19
 - Boy, I'm dying from the heat. Just look how the mercury is rising.
 - His blood be on us and on our children. --Matt. 27:25
 - The checkered flag waved and victory crossed the finish line.
 - Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.
  
Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. --Psalm 100:1-2 (KJV) The use of a particular metonymy makes a comment about the idea for which it has been substituted, and thereby helps to define that idea. Note how much more vivid "in the sweat of thy face" is in the third example above than "by labor" would have been. And in the fourth example, "mercury rising" has a more graphic, physical, and pictorial effect than would "temperature increasing." Attune yourself to such subtleties of language, and study the effects of connotation, suggestion, substitution, and metaphor.
