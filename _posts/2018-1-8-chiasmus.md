**Chiasmus** might be called "reverse parallelism," since the second part of a grammatical construction is balanced or paralleled by the first part, only in reverse order. Instead of an A,B structure (e.g., "learned unwillingly") paralleled by another A,B structure ("forgotten gladly"), the A,B will be followed by B,A ("gladly forgotten"). So instead of writing, "What is learned unwillingly is forgotten gladly," you could write, "What is learned unwillingly is gladly forgotten." Similarly, the parallel sentence, "What is now great was at first little," could be written chiastically as, "What is now great was little at first." Here are some examples:
 - He labors without complaining and without bragging rests.
 - Polished in courts and hardened in the field, Renowned for conquest, and in council skilled. --Joseph Addison
 - For the Lord is a Great God ...in whose hand are the depths of the earth; the peaks of the mountains are his also. --Psalm 95:4
Chiasmus is easiest to write and yet can be made very beautiful and effective simply by moving subordinate clauses around:
 - If you come to them, they are not asleep; if you ask and inquire of them, they do not withdraw themselves; they do not chide if you make mistakes; they do not laugh at you if you are ignorant. --Richard de Bury
Prepositional phrases or other modifiers can also be moved around to form chiastic structures. Sometimes the effect is rather emphatic:
 - Tell me not of your many perfections; of your great modesty tell me not either.
 - Just as the term "menial" does not apply to any honest labor, so no dishonest work can be called "prestigious."
At other times the effect is more subdued but still desirable. Compare the versions of these sentences, written first in chiastic and then in strictly parallel form. Which do you like better in each case?
 - On the way to school, my car ran out of gas; then it had a flat on the way home.
 - On the way to school, my car ran out of gas; then on the way home it had a flat.
 - Sitting together at lunch, the kids talked incessantly; but they said nothing at all sitting in the dentist's office.
 - Sitting together at lunch, the kids talked incessantly; but sitting in the dentist's office, they said nothing at all.
 - The computer mainframe is now on sale; available also at a discount is the peripheral equipment.
 - The computer mainframe is now on sale; the peripheral equipment is also available at a discount.
Chiasmus may be useful for those sentences in which you want balance, but which cannot be paralleled effectively, either because they are too short, or because the emphasis is placed on the wrong words. And sometimes a chiastic structure will just seem to "work" when a parallel one will not.
