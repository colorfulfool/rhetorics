**Hypophora** consists of raising one or more questions and then proceeding to answer them, usually at some length. A common usage is to ask the question at the beginning of a paragraph and then use that paragraph to answer it:

 - There is a striking and basic difference between a man's ability to imagine something and an animal's failure.... Where is it that the animal falls short? We get a clue to the answer, I think, when Hunter tells us... --Jacob Bronowski
 - What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?...What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God. --Rom. 4:1,3 (NIV)

This is an attractive rhetorical device, because asking an appropriate question appears quite natural and helps to maintain curiosity and interest. You can use hypophora to raise questions which you think the reader obviously has on his mind and would like to see formulated and answered:

 - What behavior, then, is uniquely human? My theory is this... --H. J. Campbell
 - But what was the result of this move on the steel industry? The annual reports for that year clearly indicate....

Hypophora can also be used to raise questions or to introduce material of importance, but which the reader might not have the knowledge or thought to ask for himself:

 - How then, in the middle of the twentieth century, are we to define the obligation of the historian to his facts?... The duty of the historian to respect his facts is not exhausted by... --Edward Hallett Carr
 - But it is certainly possible to ask, How hot is the oven at its hottest point, when the _average_ temperature is 425 degrees? We learned that the peak temperatures approached...

And hypophora can be used as a transitional or guiding device to change directions or enter a new area of discussion:

 - But what are the implications of this theory? And how can it be applied to the present problem?
 - How and why did caveat emptor develop? The question presents us with mysteries never fully answered. --Ivan L. Preston

Notice how a series of reasonable questions can keep a discussion lively and interesting:

 - How do we know the FTC strategy is the best, particularly in view of the complaints consumerists have made against it? Isn't there some chance that greater penalties would amount to greater deterrents? Why not get the most consumer protection simultaneously with the most punishment to offenders by easing the requirements for guilt without easing the punishment? ...It happens that that's been tried, and it didn't work very well. --Ivan L. Preston

In the above example, the writer went on for several paragraphs to discuss the case which "didn't work very well." It would also be possible for a writer to ask several questions and then answer them in an orderly way, though that has the danger of appearing too mechanical if not carefully done.
