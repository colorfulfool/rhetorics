**Pleonasm**: using more words than required to express an idea; being redundant. Normally a vice, it is done on purpose on rare occasions for emphasis:

 - We heard it with our own ears.
 - That statement is wrong, incorrect, and not true at all in any way, shape, or form.  
 - And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus Himself alone. --Matthew 17:8
