**Parataxis**:writing successive independent clauses, with coordinating conjunctions, or no conjunctions:

 - We walked to the top of the hill, and we sat down.
 - In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. --Genesis 1:1-2 (KJV)
 - The _Starfish_ went into dry-dock, it got a barnacle treatment, it went back to work.
 
In this last example above, note that a string of very short sentences can be connected by commas when the elements are parallel. Longer sentences and unparallel sentence structures need at least semicolons to connect them.
